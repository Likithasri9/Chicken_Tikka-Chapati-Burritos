Process to make Chicken Tikka Chapati Burritos....

1. Place the chicken breast pieces into a bowl or freezer bag with the yogurt, garlic, ginger, lemon juice, coriander, turmeric, cumin, paprika, chilli powder, cinnamon, salt and pepper. Mix together so that everything is combined, then cover and place in the fridge to marinate for 2-3 hours.

2. In the meanwhile , we will learn how to make chapatis.To begin with, take a large-sized bowl. Put two cups of flour along with a cup of water, salt and ghee in it. Mix well and start kneading a dough. Make sure that the dough is not too thick nor too thin. It has to be of a soft and pliable consistency. Add water to get the consistency right. Keep kneading for a while. Keep bowl aside, after we can make hot and tasty chapatis.

3. Remove the chicken bowl from the fridge and thread the chicken pieces onto four long metal skewers (you can use wooden skewers if you prefer, but soak them in water for at least an hour beforehand to prevent them from burning).

4. Brush the chicken skewers all over with the oil, then grill for 8-10 minutes, turning once or twice until fully cooked and a little charred on the outside. Make sure the chicken is cooked by slicing into a large piece and ensuring it's no longer pink in the middle.

5. Chicken tikka is prepared, now we will make chapatis. Roll out few balls from the prepared dough. Place them on a flat surface, flatten them further with the help of a rolling pin. Keep using the flour in order to prevent the rolls from sticking to the surface. Once the chapatis get the perfect round shape, place a pan on medium flame.

6. Once heated enough, put the chapati on the pan and cook from both sides. Use a pair of tongs to flip over to the other side. Keep the flame to medium as too much heat might burn the chapati. Check for the little brown spots. Once they start appearing, the chapati will start to puff, indicating that it's completely cooked. Once done, transfer in a kitchen towel to keep them warm.

7. Place the chapatis onto four plates. Add the sliced lettuce , then remove the chicken from the skewers and place on the chapatis. Top with yogurt, tomato ketup and cheddar cheese sauce , then sprinkle on the jalapeno slices, chopped red pepper and onion slices. Roll the chapatis up and wrap in foil - burrito style - and serve immediately....
