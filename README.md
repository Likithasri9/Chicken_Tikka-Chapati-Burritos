About Chicken Tikka Chapati Burritos....

These Chicken Tikka Chapati Burritos contain chicken pieces marinated in made-from-scratch tikka paste, then grilled or barbecued until just charred. So good! All wrapped up in a chapati and topped with veggies, yogurt, tomato ketup and cheddar cheese sauce. I like to add a few sliced chillies too for a bit of heat. These Chicken Tikka Chapati Burritos are definitely a meal to make me feel better about my achy muscles, without the millions of calories in a creamy Indian curry.
